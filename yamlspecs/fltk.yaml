    fltk {{ version }}.  
    FLTK (pronounced 'fulltick') is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX/Linux(X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X.
    FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in 
    GLUT emulation.

    FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically linked, but works fine as a shared library. 
    FLTK also includes an excellent UI builder called FLUID that can be used to create applications in minutes.
